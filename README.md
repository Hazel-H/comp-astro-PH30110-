Computational Astrophysics module
Module split into three small projects. 
  **1. Gravitational Problems** - using numerical methods to solve differential equations, in particular fourth-order Runge Kutta method, applied gravitational modelling of planetary orbits and N-body problems. 
  **2. Monte-Carlo methods and radiative transfer** - creating random numbers, using Monte-Carlo methods to model a random walk of a photon through an atmosphere. 
  **3. Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics**
